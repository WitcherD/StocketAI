# Task 05: DDG-DA Integration for VN30

## Task Overview
Implement DDG-DA (Data Distribution Generation for Predictable Concept Drift Adaptation) meta-learning framework to enhance baseline models for VN30 stock prediction.

## Task Status
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Dependencies**: Task 04 (Baseline Model Implementation)

## Task Goals
- Set up DDG-DA configuration for VN30 market conditions
- Train DDG-DA meta-model for concept drift adaptation
- Integrate DDG-DA with trained baseline models (TFT, LightGBM, LSTM)
- Compare DDG-DA enhanced performance vs baseline models

## Key Deliverables
- `src/model_training/ddg_da_config.py` - DDG-DA meta-learning configuration
- `src/model_training/ddg_da_trainer.py` - DDG-DA training implementation
- `src/model_training/hybrid_ddg_da_model.py` - DDG-DA enhanced models
- `experiments/02_ddg_da_training.py` - DDG-DA training experiments
- `models/ddg_da_v1.0/` - Trained DDG-DA model artifacts

## Success Criteria
- [ ] DDG-DA meta-model successfully configured for VN30
- [ ] DDG-DA training completed on VN30 historical data
- [ ] DDG-DA integration working with baseline models
- [ ] Performance improvement demonstrated over baselines
- [ ] Models ready for production deployment

## Next Task Dependencies
**Future tasks** will depend on this task's output:
- DDG-DA enhanced models for ensemble creation
- Concept drift adaptation framework for production
- Performance benchmarks for model comparison

## Technical Approach
- Use qlib's DDG-DA implementation for meta-learning
- Configure DDG-DA for VN30 market characteristics
- Create hybrid models combining DDG-DA with baselines
- Establish evaluation framework for concept drift adaptation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Set up DDG-DA configuration for VN30**
2. **Implement DDG-DA training pipeline**
3. **Create hybrid DDG-DA + baseline models**
4. **Evaluate concept drift adaptation performance**

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: DDG-DA integration complexity and tuning
- **Medium Risk**: Concept drift detection accuracy for VN30
- **Success Probability**: Medium (advanced meta-learning technique)

## Resources Required
- **Computational**: GPU recommended for DDG-DA training
- **Time**: 3-4 days for complete DDG-DA implementation
- **Dependencies**: qlib, PyTorch, trained baseline models from Task 04
