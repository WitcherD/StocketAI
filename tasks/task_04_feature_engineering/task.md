# Task 04: Feature Engineering for VN30

## Task Overview
Create comprehensive feature engineering pipeline with technical indicators and establish qlib data management utilities for VN30 stock prediction models.

## Task Status
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Dependencies**: Task 03 (VN30 Data Processing)

## Task Goals
- Create feature engineering with technical indicators using qlib expressions
- Set up qlib data management and loading utilities
- Implement feature validation and quality assessment
- Establish data preprocessing functions for model training
- Configure feature parameters optimized for VN30 characteristics

## Key Deliverables
- `src/feature_engineering/tft_feature_engineer.py` - TFT-compatible feature engineering module
- `src/feature_engineering/vn30_data_manager.py` - VN30 data management module
- `notebooks/vn30/04_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Feature engineering validation notebook

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature engineering module implemented with technical indicators
- [ ] Qlib data handler created with loading utilities
- [ ] Feature validation framework established
- [ ] Data preprocessing functions implemented
- [ ] Features ready for Task 05 (Baseline Model Training)

## Next Task Dependencies
**Task 05: Baseline Model Training** will depend on this task's output:
- Feature engineering pipeline for model training
- Qlib data management utilities
- Preprocessed data handlers
- Feature validation and quality reports

## Technical Approach
- Create feature engineering using qlib expression engine
- Set up qlib data management and loading utilities
- Implement technical indicators for VN30 characteristics
- Create feature validation and quality assessment framework
- Establish data preprocessing and normalization functions

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create feature engineering module**
2. **Set up qlib data handler**
3. **Implement technical indicators**
4. **Set up feature validation framework**
5. **Test feature engineering pipeline**

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Feature engineering implementation
- **Medium Risk**: VN30-specific feature optimization
- **Success Probability**: High (established feature engineering practices)

## Resources Required
- **Computational**: CPU processing sufficient
- **Time**: 2-3 days for complete feature engineering pipeline
- **Dependencies**: qlib, pandas, numpy, processed VN30 data from Task 03
