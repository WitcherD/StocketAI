Model Training Module for StocketAI

This module provides model training infrastructure and algorithms
for financial time series prediction. It supports multiple model
types including tree-based, neural networks, and transformer-based
models using qlib and other frameworks.

Key Components:
- Model training pipelines and workflows
- Hyperparameter optimization and tuning
- Cross-validation and model selection
- Ensemble methods and model stacking
- Training data preparation and preprocessing

The module follows the project's coding standards and integrates with
the feature engineering and evaluation pipelines.
