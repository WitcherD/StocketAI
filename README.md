# StocketAI

**Predict stock prices with AI - Simple, Research-Focused, Extensible**

---

## What is StocketAI?

StocketAI helps you predict stock price movements using machine learning. It can forecast whether stocks will go up or down in 1, 3, or 6 months. The system is designed for researchers and analysts who want to experiment with different data sources and prediction models.

**Key Benefits:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Research-First**: Built for experimentation and scientific validation
- ðŸ”§ **Extensible**: Easy to add new data sources or prediction models
- ðŸ“Š **Multi-Source**: Works with multiple Vietnamese financial data providers
- ðŸ§ª **Reproducible**: Consistent results across different runs

---

## Motivation

As a solution architect without finance expertise or Python development background, I want to build an AI model for each company from the VN30 list to predict stock prices in 1, 3, and 6-month horizons with low risk using all available data. This project leverages vnstock for comprehensive Vietnamese market data acquisition and qlib for quantitative finance modeling to create a research-focused prediction system that balances technical sophistication with practical usability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Windows 11 with developer tools enabled
- Conda (mandatory - venv/virtualenv not permitted)
- Git for Windows with proper line ending configuration

### Environment Setup

```powershell
# Create conda environment
conda create -n StocketAI python=3.12 -y
conda activate StocketAI

# Install core packages
conda install pip pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn plotly -y
conda install scikit-learn lightgbm xgboost -y
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch -y
conda install tensorflow -c conda-forge -y

# Install development tools
conda install jupyter jupyterlab pytest flake8 black mypy -y
