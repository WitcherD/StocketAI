Besides, the retrieval of the world's oil price is having favorable effects on the world's rubber price.   ","  Economic risk: Vietnam's rubber industry is mostly affected by global macro factors as rubber price is determined by the world's rubber price.

Meanwhile, the production cost is higher than the selling price, leading to ineffective trading and reducing business results during the period. Risk of unstable input sources: The market of input materials is getting more intensive, along with competition among intermediate traders, which pushes purchasing prices and poses threats to the Company's source of input materials. Other risks: In addition to windstorms and heavy rain, diseases in growing rubber gardens are spreading over Company's rubber farms, damaging a large number of rubber trees, and affecting latex amounts.
