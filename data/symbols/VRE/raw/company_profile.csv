According to VnDirect, the scale of investment in the retail market is forecast to increase to $350 billion by 2025, thanks to the income growth of a segment of consumers. As a result, the retail market in Vietnam will also become an attractive destination for foreign investors.  ","  In order to maintain the operation of trading centers at a high standard level and achieve growth objectives, the Company has to invest a large amount of capital in the construction and development of new trade centers and the upgradation of existing ones. In addition to the use of profit from its projects under operation for re-investment and expansion of the nationwide trade center network, the Company mobilizes capital from other sources, including (1) capital mobilization through international and/or domestic loan market ; (2) issuance of international and/or domestic bonds; (3) issuance of shares, based on the conditions of the financial market at the time of capital mobilization. As a result, its capital mobilization will dramatically affect the progress of trade center projects and business performance in the coming years. There is increasing competition in the retail site leasing market due to the entrance of new trade centers. Such competition decreases the occupation rate and the number of customers visiting and purchasing goods, which leads to a decline in its revenue and lessees' payment capacity. To maintain its position, the Company has to reduce its retail unit cost or invest more capital to enhance the quality of trade centers to attract more customers. The profit and value of its trade centers depend mainly on its competition against other trade centers in the region. The rapid development of technologies has changed transaction methods. As E-commerce becomes more and more popular, there is a tendency for customers to view, select and purchase goods online instead of traditional shops, even trade centers.
